# cpplabs (C++ Labs)
this is a compilation of all the lab assignments I coded when I took my first C++ class at the college I currently attend. I thought publishing this repository would be beneficial for me as everything is in one place, and I can also showcase my experience coding in this language.

everything here has been coded using the Dev-C++ IDE
